## Notes

- `test_list_titles_second_page_empty` demonstrates that when paging beyond the limit of
the result set an empty array will be returned. Instead, it might be desirable to check
for this and return a warning.

- I have left sample title data as is and accessed it directly from the JSON file for simplicity.
In a production system the `data_store.py` file would access title data from an external source,
i.e. a database or another API.
